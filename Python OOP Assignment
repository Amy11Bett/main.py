# ðŸ§  Python OOP Assignment

This repository contains the submission for the **Object-Oriented Programming Assignment** which includes:

## ðŸ“Œ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

- âœ… Created a class `Smartphone` with attributes like brand, model, storage, and battery life.
- âœ… Added methods like `specs()` and `charge()` to simulate real behavior.
- âœ… Extended the class with `SuperSmartphone` to demonstrate inheritance and encapsulation.
- âœ… Demonstrated constructor usage with `__init__`.

## ðŸŽ­ Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

- âœ… Created a parent class `Vehicle` with a method `move()`.
- âœ… Created multiple child classes: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`.
- âœ… Each subclass defines its own version of `move()` to showcase **polymorphism**.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
